                    Until 1948, part of the Arab village of Selma existed on the site of the neighborhood. This village had in 1931 3,691 inhabitants and about 800 houses. On the eve of the War of Independence, the village had about 7,600 residents, most of whom were residents from the area who moved to live in this village, which is considered the center of the Arab population. Among the residents were also wealthy people from Jaffa who built village houses there. From the village, snipers fired at the neighboring Jewish neighborhoods (the Hatikva neighborhood, the Ezra neighborhood and Yad Eliyahu).

                    During Operation Chametz, which took place on April 22, 1948, the village of Selma was captured, and its residents fled to Jaffa. Following the declaration of independence of the State of Israel, the town's residents were settled by Jewish refugees from the area and new immigrants, mainly families of Yemeni immigrants, who arrived in an operation on eagles' wings. Later, barracks and temporary structures were also erected to accommodate additional immigrants. The area of ​​the village is divided into three areas - Selma A, B and C. In November 1948, most of the village's areas were annexed to Tel Aviv and about a third of them (Selma III) to Ramat Gan

The place is very beautiful and gives the atmosphere of a village for everything (the air is relatively clean in the city and you can walk with the children in huge parks and beautiful gardens. You can go and see animals such as a goat and a bambi in the park at the end of the village).
