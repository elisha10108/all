                    <p class=" col-md-12">  most of whom were residents from the area who moved to live in this village, which is considered the center of the Arab population.

The area of ​​the village is divided into three areas - Selma A, B and C. In November 1948, most of the village's areas were annexed to Tel Aviv and about a third of them (Selma III) to Ramat
                      Later, the name of the village was changed from "Salma" to "Kfar Shalem", which was now a very crowded Tel Aviv neighborhood - with about 20,000 inhabitants. Apart from the houses of the Arab village, the neighborhoods of Ramat Hen, Givat Geula, Ramat HaShikma, the Bulgariim neighborhood, the Hefetz Haim neighborhood and the Ramat Gan National Park were built on the land of the village.

                        <p class=" col-md-12">The state sought to demolish the village houses and build new houses. In 1965, the Construction Evacuation Law was enacted and a process of evacuating the residents from the neighborhood began. This process has known ups and downs in the issue of resident-establishment ratio; One of the most serious quarrels occurred in December 1982, when a resident of the neighborhood, Shimon Yehoshua, tried to prevent the demolition of his house and was shot dead by a police officer. In the early 1990s, hundreds of families receiving compensation were evacuated. Many of them received housing in high-rise housing in the area, which soon became, due to housing overcrowding, what residents call "slams on pillars." For some of the families, the Tel Aviv-Yafo municipality allowed them to continue living in ground-level buildings. All two families were given a half-dunam plot, and permission to build a two-family house. Due to the rarity of detached houses, and the population exchange policy in Tel Aviv, the Tel Aviv-Yafo Municipality has decided that all detached houses in Tel Aviv will pay a uniform property tax, regardless of the other services provided there. About 300 families that were not included in the arrangements of the 1990s, now live in complexes destined for demolition.

                          Against 30 families out of the approximately 300 families living in the complexes to be demolished, an eviction order was issued without compensation from the residents, as it was alleged that the lands on which the residents' homes stand do not belong to the state (under guardianship of absentee property), but are privately owned. It was argued that since the lands belonged in 1948 to a British investor who was not considered absent, they were not expropriated by the state, they are not owned by her and therefore there is no obligation to compensate the residents. The Supreme Court accepted this claim, and the eviction by force took place on December 25, 2007. Activists and social organizations criticized this ruling on the basis of the claim of distributive justice and ethno-class inequality. Thus, for example, the lawyer Dr. Sandy Kedar argued that although it is possible that in the narrow legal aspect the Supreme Court was right in its ruling, "if you look at what happens in an entire village compared, for example, to Kibbutz Galil Yam, it can be argued that it is a discriminatory policy bordering on illegality ".</p>

And delay the execution of the project, claiming that the issue of expropriation of the land from their hands is illegal and the issue of compensation with them has not yet been settled.

                      In January 2020, Minister of Transportation Bezalel Smutrich held a long series of discussions on the issue and decided on the adoption of the "Yitzhaki Outline", which was formulated by a committee chaired by former housing cabinet chairman Avigdor Yitzhaki and provides adequate compensation to future evacuees.here are several elementary schools in the neighborhood, the best-known of which, the Tel Hai school, is considered one of the best schools in Israel according to all relevant indices, following a reform led by the school's principal, Einat Berger-Arizona, over the past decade </p>
